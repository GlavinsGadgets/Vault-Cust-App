            <h4>1997 - John sets up origin</h4>
            <p>After developing a niche of urban wear in the family store, John sets up a store of his own rooted in board culture. Over the years a close relationship with the city youth and street cultures is formed.</p>

            <h4>2013 - A few years later...</h4>
            <p>John had been listening to young Galway citizens and continued to be an active part in the development of the Latin Quarter and city festivities. <br> In a city enveloped in culture, sport and rain, John saw there was a lack of a safe, weather proof venue for young people to be active and social all year round.</p>
